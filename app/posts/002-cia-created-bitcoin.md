# How the CIA could destroy bitcoin (or, why they probably created it)

They could infiltrate the ASIC manufacturers and plant hardware-level backdoors/malware. 5-10 years later, the hardware is used by most miners.

They could also just assassinate people involved.

The fact that this didn't happen makes it likely that they created it. This theory is further supported by the fact that it came out of the USA specifically at a time of debt crisis and how it gives the USA an advantage for adopting it before other nations, an adoption which is suspiciously unnatural.
