# 3D screens idea

Essentially holography + cymatics.

Holography is used for generating 3D images. It's a real thing, and although it's kind of an optical illusion, it's really fascinating and you need to look into it. It uses a film which has a wavefront encoded in it. Currently once you make such a film, you get one static hologram but that's it, it doesn't change. If this encoded pattern could somehow be dynamically changed, then the generated 3D image could be manipulated and animated. To achieve that I think we could use cymatics with electricity. It should be possible to manipulate the engraved patterns in the film.

Currently even static holographic screens need lots of space for the lighting setup, but as technology progresses we may see 3D screens in a practical format some day.
