# 3D Screens

TLDR: holography + cymatics

Holography is used for generating 3D images. It uses a film which has a wavefront encoded in it. If this encoded pattern can be dynamically changed, e.g. using cymatics or electricity, then the generated 3D image can be manipulated and animated.

This could be made very compact as technology progresses and we may see 3D screens in the future.
